Sign Up flow:

Sign-Up/Login: The flow likely starts with a clean and intuitive sign-up or login screen where users can enter their credentials. For new users, the sign-up process might involve entering basic information like name, email, and password.

Authentication: Incorporating an OTP (One-Time Password) frame where users receive a code via email or SMS for verification during the sign-up process or when logging in for the first time. This ensures a secure authentication process.

Error Handling: Designing error messages or prompts to guide users in case of incorrect login details or issues with the OTP verification process. Clear and concise messages help users understand and resolve any issues they encounter.

Logout: Including a simple and accessible logout option, possibly in a menu or profile settings, allowing users to easily log out from their account when needed.

User-Friendly Interface: Utilizing Figma's design tools to create a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate interface for the sign-up/login flow. This could involve clear typography, well-placed input fields, and intuitive buttons for a seamless user experience.

Security Considerations: Prioritizing the security of user data by implementing best practices, such as encryption for sensitive information and secure authentication protocols.
